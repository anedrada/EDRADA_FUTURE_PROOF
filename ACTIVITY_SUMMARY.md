## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| npm not found | Install Node.js from nodejs.org |
| Port 5173 in use | Kill the process or use different port |
| Git errors | Check you're in right directory (`pwd`) |
| GitHub won't connect | Verify URL and username are correct |
